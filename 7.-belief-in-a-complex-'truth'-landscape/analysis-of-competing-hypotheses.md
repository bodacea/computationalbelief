# Analysis of Competing Hypotheses

Analysis of Competing Hypotheses \(ACH\) came out of the CIA in the 1970s.  Like abductive reasoning, its purpose is to assign a most probable explanation for a series of observations.   ACH has 7 main steps:

* Hypothesis.  Create a set of potential hypotheses.  This is similar to the hypothesis generation used in hypothesis-driven development \(HDD\), but generally has graver potential consequences than how a system's usrs are likely to respond to a new website, and is generally encouraged to be wilder and more creative \(DHCP theory might come in useful for that\). 
* Evidence.  List evidence and arguments for each hypothesis. 
* Diagnostics. List evidence against each hypothesis; use that evidence to compare the relatively llikelihood of different hypotheses. 
* Refinement.  Review findings so far, find gaps in knowledge, collect more evidence \(especially evidence that can remove hypotheses\). 
* Inconsistency. Estimate the relative likelihood of each hypothesis; remove the weakest hypotheses. 
* Sensitivity. Run sensitivity analysis on evidence and arguments. 
* Conclusions and evidence.  Present most likely explanation, and reasons why other explanations were rejected. 

The matrix of evidence vs hypotheses is key in ACH.  In real-world situations, this matrix is both large and sparse; other representations of it include belief networks \(Elsaessar\), with bet-like weights assigned to the input evidence \("value of information"\).
