# computationalbelief

Starting a 10-session exploration of computational belief methods.  Initial plan is to explore this:

1. What is belief? What do we hold to be truths, and how do we learn them?
2. Human belief: Psychology of belief. Collapsed and non-collapsed beliefs: what we can learn from Aspergers and other ways to process perceptions.
3. Computational belief: Bayesian and frequentist statistics
4. Practical uses of belief: AB testing and friends
5. Belief given partial information: perception, partial beliefs and multiple-viewpoint theory. 
6. Beyond normative beliefs: building systems that don’t just go for the middle. 
7. Belief in a complex landscape of ‘truths’ and ‘lies': ACH, Phemes etc. 
8. Challenging belief: the interactions between creativity and knowledge \(CK theory etc\), managing rapid belief change \(e.g. scientific revolutions\) and gaming belief changes in populations \(hello, information injection and information incest detection\). 
9. Lies, damned lies: how evidence and propaganda interact \(or don’t\), and the influence of desire. 
10. Trust but verify. More real-world applications of computational belief; more theories and places to explore.
