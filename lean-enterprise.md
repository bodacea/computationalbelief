Lean startup: Build-Measure-Learn

* Learn early and often about your customer
* Test and get feedback
* Base decisions on learnings, not assumptions

There are your beliefs. Your customers' beliefs. Your beliefs about their beliefs.

recent article suggested that we don't do customer analysis stage; we go straight to learning. That feels right.

The moving parts: people, process, technology, culture

Internet is made of belief, and has a lot of these. If I talk to you, I trust it's you, I trust you're \(mostly\) telling me what you believe to be true.  If I read a page and interact with it, same. And now AI.  How do we retain our human belief system when we can be very easily fooled?

What about gaming - is it possible for our competitors to game us?  What becomes 'fair' in this environment?

"What is the mission of the press?" "What is the mission of the org?" "what is the mission of your sector?" \(mission == "commander's intent" in warfare\).  Understand your environment, your ecosystem.  Understand that you won't ever understand all of it \(the "naughty baby" problem\) and build in adaptation to that.  Understand that your world drifts over time \('the structure of scientific revolutions'\) - understand what is relatively stable and what you need to track.

What is the mission of intelligence? Knowing what's going on? Adapting what's going on to fit a larger goal? Both?  But you never get perfect information, or perfect goals, so you need to add in time: test, learn, adapt.

Goals are outcomes, not outputs

Personas: Who are these people? What are their beliefs? How do they believe things?  Also need to look at markets: is there a hole in the market, is there a market in the hole \(as in, how many of each type of person is there, which of these types is it worth reaching out to, and why?\)

Causes of uncertainty...  \(missing data -&gt; imputation, \)... how much uncertainty is acceptable?  How much misinformation before the belief system starts to collapse?

2-player and multi-player games: how and when do you know that your dissonance isn' t from 'normal' measurement uncertainty, but is from a 'game'?

Pothole measurement: what if you're wrong because you mismatched your assumptions and your underlying system?
