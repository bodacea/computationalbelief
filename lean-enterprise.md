Lean startup: Build-Measure-Learn

* Learn early and often about your customer
* Test and get feedback
* Base decisions on learnings, not assumptions

There are your beliefs. Your customers' beliefs. Your beliefs about their beliefs.

recent article suggested that we don't do customer analysis stage; we go straight to learning. That feels right.

The moving parts: people, process, technology, culture

Internet is made of belief, and has a lot of these. If I talk to you, I trust it's you, I trust you're \(mostly\) telling me what you believe to be true.  If I read a page and interact with it, same. And now AI.  How do we retain our human belief system when we can be very easily fooled?

What about gaming - is it possible for our competitors to game us?  What becomes 'fair' in this environment?
