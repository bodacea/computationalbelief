# Talk Outline

Data science isn't just about the process of moving from questions and data to insights. There's a lot of that, but there's also what I think of as 'applied cynicism': the art of questioning everything in the process, from the biases of people collecting or generating data to the scope and validity of results.  Some of this cynicism is built into the process; some of it is those "oh, wait" moments when a result just doesn't ring true.  That's useful in an environment whose inputs have the usual errors and uncertainties of anything involving humans; what's becoming more interesting now is how we do data science in an environment with deliberate misinformation and competitive intent.   I plan to look at our current data science mechanisms for handling uncertainty/error, at existing mechanisms for misinformation, and pre-big-data reasoning systems to see what we could potentially do.

45 mins? 15-20 slides max

Intro

* Fake news examples... 
* Fake data in the development cycle \(e.g. deliberate wrong answers to surveys, people messing with your baseline etc\)

What is Data science

* the process
* scientific method and hypotheses
* Development applications: HDD, decision support, AB testing

DS and uncertainty

* Belief
* Bayesian probability theory
* law of large numbers
* Sampling and sample sizes: effects on error bars
* Uncertainty in development: why agile cycles help to adjust... 

The applied cyncism part of DS

* "art"

Misinformation

* Types of misinformation
* Propaganda
* Fake news mechanisms
* Intelligence and counterintelligence
* Misinformation in development

Misinformation handling mechanisms

* ACH
* crowd verification
* Pre-Bayesian reasoning systems

Conclusions

* Where to go from here
* Thank you

Appendix

* Useful things to read
* Belief in communities
* Belief hacking
* Lessons from robotics
* Belief as a moving thing \(and how to track it\)
