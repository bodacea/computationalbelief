# Talk Outline

Data science isn't just about the process of moving from questions and data to insights. There's a lot of that, but there's also what I think of as 'applied cynicism': the art of questioning everything in the process, from the biases of people collecting or generating data to the scope and validity of results.  Some of this cynicism is built into the process; some of it is those "oh, wait" moments when a result just doesn't ring true.  That's useful in an environment whose inputs have the usual errors and uncertainties of anything involving humans; what's becoming more interesting now is how we do data science in an environment with deliberate misinformation and competitive intent.   I plan to look at our current data science mechanisms for handling uncertainty/error, at existing mechanisms for misinformation, and pre-big-data reasoning systems to see what we could potentially do.
