# Lies

When someone lies to you, it leaves a trace in your brain.  We're wired that way.  When we're given a new piece of information, we first treat it as true, then question it.  Questioning anything means holding it in your head and examining it... by doing this, we commit thoughts to memory, which persists even after disproving those thoughts.  Those traces are stronger when we're surprised by a new 'fact'; even when we know something is false, it can be hard to get away from its effects. And those effects can be subtle.

For example, if I borrow a friend's car,  joke that I've crashed it, and then immediately laugh and say "no I didn't", they know their car is \(probably\) okay, but that's also left a trace in their brain that I'm a bad driver.

Disproving lies takes effort: If I tell a whole stream of lies, then what I'm also doing is shutting down people's ability to process what I'm saying.  One way to handle this is to separate out the source of the information \(e.g. the person\), the channel it's coming through \(e.g. an internet site\) and the information itself, and place different degrees of belief on each of these.

If you repeat a lie enough, it can start to look like the truth, especially if you arrange for that lie to come in different forms from several different sources \(an old and sometimes useful CIA trick\).  These "illusory truths" are the reason you're shown the same advertisements over and over: even though you know that car won't make you sexy, the repetition of that 'fact' will eventually, despite everything you try to stop it, make its way somewhere into your brain.
