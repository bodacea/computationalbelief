# Lies

When someone lies to you, it leaves a trace in your brain.  We're wired that way.  When we're given a new piece of information, we first treat it as true, then question it.  Questioning anything means holding it in your head and examining it... by doing this, we commit thoughts to memory, which persists even after disproving those thoughts.  Those traces are stronger when we're surprised by a new 'fact'; even when we know something is false, it can be hard to get away from its effects. And those effects can be subtle. 

For example, if I borrow a friend's car,  joke that I've crashed it, and then immediately laugh and say "no I didn't", they know their car is \(probably\) okay, but that's also left a trace in their brain that I'm a bad driver.
